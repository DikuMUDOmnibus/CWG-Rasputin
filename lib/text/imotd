Welcome to the beta release of CWG-Rasputin!

It is VERY IMPORTANT to note that in the CWG-Rasputin system, the concept
of IMMORTAL LEVEL is no longer applicable. We have converted to an ADMIN
FLAG model which controls (in much the same way the level system did) who
can access what as an ADMIN. 

Again - YOUR IMPLEMENTOR CHARACTER IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE LEVEL 34!

You will need to use : set <character> adminlevel <value> to grant them 
powers. Set them to adminlevel 0 if you wish to remove all their powers.
See "help adminlevel" for more.
