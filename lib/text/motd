  We are converting the rules of CircleMUD to follow the SRD published under
  the Open Gaming License. For more information on the SRD please follow the
  link: @ghttp://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35@n

  There are a few new commands you'll need to know. 

  @yfeat@n will show you your feats.
  @ylearn@n will allow you to learn new feats.
  @ygain@n will allow you to advance a level when you have enough xp.
  @ytrain@n will allow you to train attributes if you level enough.
  @ymemorize@n will let you learn spells if you are a spell caster.
  @yscribe@n will let you write spells on scrolls or spellbooks.
  @yresurrect@n will let you return from the dead (@rwith xp penalty@n!)

All of these commands are also now documented in the help system.
