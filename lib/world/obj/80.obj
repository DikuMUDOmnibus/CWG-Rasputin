rosfanth~
  A rosfanth-sreklas (pronounced ROASE-FANTH ZRIK-LAHSS) is a part of the
uniform of the Ohari Elite and National Guards. It is an inverted metal
triangle, similar to bronze plate but lighter, that slips over the head and
covers the front and back at the same time. Those of the National Guard are
red, and those of the Elite Guard are dark purple.

fountain~
  The fountain is about 30' in diameter and is carved from black marble...
wait! On closer inspection, you see that it is granite, painted to LOOK like
marble.
  The water comes out of a 10' tall statue of Idat the Dissembler- or, at
least, her most common mortal form, that of a tall, gaunt female with long
black hair and vacous, haunting eyes. The statue is running her fingers
through her hair, out of which the water falls in droplets.~

lori kisanth lOrI~
  A lOrI-kisanth (translated as "thing that shoots fire") is an interesting
piece of Oharian technology. It is a long metal tube with two handles, open
on one end. Into the open end is packed small explosive charge, then a
flammable chemical paste. When a trigger on the handle is pulled, flint and
steel ignite the explosive and the paste, now a blinding crimson sphere of
light and heat, flies towards the target. It is a VERY dangerous weapon, but
the fact that is it very hard to reload tends to limit it's use. It is
available currently only to members of the Oharian Guard above the rank of
Sergeant. Whoever left this lying around is in trouble, bigtime.

where you got it, it's no wonder it's completely incomprehensible.
