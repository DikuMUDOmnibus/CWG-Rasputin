mail chain hauberk~
This armor is made of interlocking metal rings. It is always worn with a
layer of quilted fabric padding underneath to prevent painful chafing and
to cushion the impact of blows. Several layers of mail are normally hung
over vital areas. The links yield easily to blows, absorbing some of the 
shock. Most of the weight of this armor is carried on the shoulders and it
is uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.
The suit of chain mail is of fair quality, with a large red raven upon the
chest. It is the symbol of the Red Ravens of the the Empire, a mercenary
group that helps the Purple Dragons defend the Helmlands.
