buff coat~
This was the standard piece of armor throughtout the period. It offered no
protection against firearms, but neither did heavier armor. Yet it was
sufficient to stop an arrow or turn aside a clumsy sword slash. The buff
coat was supple, not hardened leather.

hat~
The hat is almost silly looking. It is bright purple and green died leather,
and has some silly tassels hanging from it.
