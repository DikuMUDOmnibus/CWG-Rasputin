A demon from the wastelands of Loncar is here, looking for trouble.

Standing only 2 1/2 feet, the Loncaric demon looks like he is

before you looks...dangerous.

dziak high priestess demon~
Dziak, demon-priestess of Lammashta~
Flying around the room on leathery wings, the demon Dziak glares at you!
~
Over 7' in length, the demon-priestess Dziak is dressed
in light battle armor, designed around her winged, four-armed 
body. Otherwise, she appears quite attractive with large, 
round eyes and a cute smile. Too bad she wants to kill you and 
tear out your soul.
