shade disembodied~
a shade~
Floating around the room is a disembodied shade!
~
Before you floats a human shaped cloud of wist mist. Dark spots serve as
eyes, and thin tendrils hang in place of arms and legs. The mouth hangs
open in a perpetually silent scream. Thin wisps of vapor escape instead
of sound.

A Tsalari robed demon flies around cackling insanely!
~
The rune ensrcibed robes, and body tattooing reveal this demon to be one
of Marduk's Tsalari. His skin tone is reddish, and he has two small horns
protruding from his head. He flies around the room on large, leathery
wings. The skin over his bones is drawn and withered. He glares at you
from hollow blue pinpoints of light.
